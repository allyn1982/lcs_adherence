# Identifying and modeling patient non-adherence to lung cancer screening across multiple screening time points.

In this article, we conducted three experiments.

* Experiment_1: Identifying predictors of patient non-adherence to baseline Lung-RADS recommendations using logistic regression.
* Experiment_2: Using machine learning-based models to predict patient non-adherent to baseline Lung-RADS recommendations.
* Experiment_3: Invesitigating the association between changes in Lung-RADS scores and patient non-adherence to Lung-RADS recommendations across multiple screening time points.
