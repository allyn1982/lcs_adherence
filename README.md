In this article, we conducted three experiments.

* Experiment_1: Identifying predictors of patient non-adherence to baseline Lung-RADS recommendations using logistic regression.

* Experiment_2: Using machine learning-based models to predict patient non-adherent to baseline Lung-RADS recommendations.

* Experiment_3: Invesitigating the association between changes in Lung-RADS scores and patient non-adherence to Lung-RADS recommendations across multiple screening time points.


Notes:
1. Dummy data is provided for each experiment to help run the model.
2. When running each model, change the directory of the dummy data to your local directory.
3. Experiment 2: When using dummy data in main.py, set num_splits to 3 instead of 10 in Line 19.
